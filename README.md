**Step 8.** On the Web Bluetooth® interface you can see devices appearing.\
![Step 8](/public/illustrations/routerDevAppear.PNG "Step 8")  
**Step 9.** On P2P Server device, a click on B1 send a notification to P2P Router. 
This notification message is forwarded to the smartphone and displayed on the interface.\
![Step 9](/public/illustrations/notifON.PNG "Step 9")\
**Step 10.** On Web Bluetooth® interface click the Light button to write a message to the corresponding P2P Server devices. This write message is sent first to P2P Router and then routed to its destination.\
